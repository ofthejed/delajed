Hi, my name is <span class="brand">Jed</span>. I make websites and design *things* that help people.

## What I can do

### Web design and development

Your website is a reflection of your brand. Whether you’re starting from scratch or redesigning an existing site, I can help make sure that its look, feel, and experience represents you and your brand at your best.

* Responsive and accessible design
* HTML / PHP / CSS / JavaScript
* CMS implementation
* Performance optimization

### Content strategy and creation

Good content is at the foundation of good design and experience. I can help you establish a voice that reflects your brand, and a structure that allows for your audience to easily navigate and understand the story you’re telling.

* Content maps
* Information architecture
* Creative writing and production
* Wireframes

### Marketing

Your audience just doesn’t live on your website. I can help you expand your brand through other channels to strengthen your message, and reach more people.

* Logo design
* Email newsletters
* Social media and print collateral
