In March 2016 I worked with Humber College's Office of Sustainability to redesign and redevelop their website to better coincide with the college's brand guidelines.

One major challenge of the redesign was finding a way to distill all of the information that existed on the website, into more readable chunks. We were able to accomplish this by leaning heavily on the use of icons and graphics, and establishing an information architecture that better grouped content.
