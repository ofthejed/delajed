We Got You is an initiative by Humber College's Student Success and Engagement to centralize all of its student services into one place.

In Fall 2016, I worked with Humber College's Student Success and Engagement department to redesign and redevelop its "We Got You" website. The goal of the redesign was to allow for further promotion of news, events and social media properties, without getting in the way of students finding the service they're looking for.
