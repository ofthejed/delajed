As part of the We Got You campaign, I've spent the past two years working with Humber College's Student Success and Engagement team to design and develop a consistent look, feel, and experience among its over twenty web properties. By early-2016, we had every website fully converted.

We're currently in the transition of once again moving these websites to a newly designed and developed visual update that aims to convey a closer look at the student experience, with an emphasis on the use of more imagery and video.
